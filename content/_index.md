Hi, I‘m Marco. I am a founder and managing partner of Pandata GmbH, a Berlin-based data consultancy firm specializing in data strategy, business intelligence, and artificial intelligence, with a team of 30.
I hold degrees in Computer Science (B.Sc.) and Business Administration (M.Sc.) from ESCP Europe, having studied in London, Paris, and Berlin. My professional journey includes roles such as Business Engineer at Rocket Internet during its IPO phase and experience as a web and mobile app developer at a startup in Rio de Janeiro.
With over a decade of experience in the data sector, I regularly speak about data and AI at conferences and share my experience in workshops. 
I create plotter art, combining my technical expertise with artistic expression to generate unique algorithmic designs that bridge the gap between computation and visual aesthetics. My works explore the intersection of mathematical precision and creative randomness, often incorporating data-driven elements that reflect my background in computer science and data analytics.
I make music, playing live sets using hardware synthesizers to create immersive electronic soundscapes. This hands-on approach to music production reflects my broader philosophy of combining technical mastery with creative expression, whether I’m architecting data solutions or performing live electronic music.
